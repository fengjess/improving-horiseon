# improving-horiseon

Horiseon's website failed to meet accessibility standards. Its codebase required semantic markup to meet those standards. 

## Edits Made

    - Added semantic HTML elements
    - Restructued the coding
    - Added alt attributes to images
    - Improved its title for search engine optimization
